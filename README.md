# Starting the React Project

To start the project in React, follow these steps:

1. Open the command line terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your React project by using the `cd` command followed by the directory name. For example:
    ```bash
    cd cake-app
    ```
3. Once you are in the root directory of your React project, start the development server by running the following command:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
4. After running the command, your default web browser should open automatically, and you should see your React application running. If it doesn't open automatically, you can manually open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view your application.
